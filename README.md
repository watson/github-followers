# github-followers

A web server that lists your Github followers based on rank:

http://github-followers.herokuapp.com

This is very much work in progress. Feel free to contribute :)

## Todo

- I should really use a template system! Maybe use React while we're at it
- Index the worlds 100k Github most active users instead of only 10k
- The design needs a lot of love

...feel free to open Pull Requests :)

## Run locally
