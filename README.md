This is very much work in progress. Feel free to contribute :)

This work is based on the
[redox/top-github-users](https://github.com/redox/top-github-users) repo.

## Todo

- Index the worlds 100k Github most active users instead of only 10k
- The design needs a lot of love

...feel free to open Pull Requests :)
